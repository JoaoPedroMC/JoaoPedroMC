### Hi there, I'm João 👋

I've created this profile to show some of the projects I'm currently working as I study new technologies.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Itaú Unibanco](https://www.itau.com.br/) as a software engineer. I develop for the credit card app, more specifically to personal loan.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kotlin, Golang, Terraform and AWS.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on back-end projects to help people and also learn with them.
